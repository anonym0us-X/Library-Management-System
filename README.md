# Library-Management-System
While learning the Django web development framework, along the learning process i started creating the site for library management system. 
The main objective for the creation of this website was to learn the django framework in-depth by having a hands-on project experience, and has really helped me learn the django framework. 

ABOUT THE WEBSITE
the website consist of 4 pages, 
1. Home page
2. Add book page
3. View books
4. Search book

From above you might get a baisc insight of the website. If you may ask for the deletion of the book, the answer is that that the 'DELETE' option is added in the 'View books' section itself. Making it easy to access and manage the books.
